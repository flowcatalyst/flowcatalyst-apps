/**
 * Transition a shipment from `unfinalised` → `ready`.
 *
 * Invoked by the warehouse/packing operation once goods are confirmed packed.
 * Once `ready`, the shipment is eligible to be planned onto a `Trip` by a
 * separate use case (deferred — Trip aggregate doesn't exist yet).
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - Tenant must be set on the scope.
 *  - Shipment must exist in this tenant.
 *  - Shipment must currently be in `unfinalised`.
 *  - Already-`ready` shipments produce a `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION`
 *    (`SHIPMENT_NOT_UNFINALISED`) — caller decides whether to ignore.
